### Core Features Implemented

#### MCP Protocol ✅
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
- Stdio communication as specified
- Proper request/response handling
- Error handling with standardized error codes

#### Tools ✅
1. **Profile Tool** (`profile(account)`)
   - Account validation (handle/DID formats)
   - DID resolution with 10s timeout
   - CAR file fetching and parsing
   - Profile record extraction
   - Markdown formatting with collapsible raw data

2. **Search Tool** (`search(account, query)`)
   - Account and query validation (max 500 chars)
   - Post record extraction from CAR files
   - Unicode NFKC text normalization
   - Multi-field search (text, alt-text, external links)
   - Result scoring and ranking
   - Markdown highlighting with **bold** matches

#### BlueSky Integration ✅
- Handle to DID resolution via XRPC
- PDS discovery using PLC directory
- CAR file streaming download (60s timeout)
- CBOR/IPLD record parsing
- AT Protocol record type support

#### Cache System ✅
- Two-tier directory structure: `{cache}/{prefix}/{did}/`
- Platform-specific cache locations (UserCacheDir)
- Atomic file operations with `.tmp` suffix
- TTL management (24h repos, 1h profiles)
- Cache metadata with HTTP headers
- Background cleanup capabilities

#### Error Handling ✅
- Comprehensive error codes:
  - `invalid_input`
  - `did_resolve_failed` 
  - `repo_fetch_failed`
  - `repo_parse_failed`
  - `not_found`
  - `timeout`
  - `cache_error`
- Timeout configuration (10s DID, 60s CAR, 120s total)
- Input validation with detailed error messages

### Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies Used
- `github.com/ipld/go-car/v2` - CAR file parsing
- `github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2` - CBOR encoding/decoding  
- `golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm` - Unicode normalization
- `golang.org/x/sync` - Concurrency utilities
- Standard library for HTTP, JSON, file operations

#### Go-Specific Features Leveraged
- Cross-platform cache directory resolution
- Concurrent request handling with contexts
- Streaming HTTP downloads with progress tracking
- Atomic file operations for cache safety
- Static binary compilation for easy deployment

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:
- MCP protocol compliance tests
- Input validation tests
- Error handling verification
- Build and deployment verification

```bash
# Build
go build -o bin/bluesky-mcp ./cmd/bluesky-mcp

# Test
./test_go_mcp.sh
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Package Structure**: Followed Go conventions with `internal/` for implementation details and `pkg/` for reusable components
2. **Error Handling**: Used structured error types with MCP-compatible error codes
3. **Concurrency**: Leveraged Go's context package for timeout management
4. **Caching**: Implemented atomic operations to prevent corruption
5. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite for protocol validation

## Result

The Go BlueSky MCP Server POC is **fully functional** and ready for integration with MCP clients. It demonstrates:

- Complete feature parity with the Rust specification
- Excellent Go ecosystem integration
- Production-ready error handling and caching
- Cross-platform deployment capability
- Clean, maintainable architecture following Go best practices

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements specified in `docs/7.2-go.md` and provides a solid foundation for BlueSky MCP integration.
