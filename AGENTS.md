# Autoreply

The code currently implements a full version of [autoreply/npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoreply) plus two prototypes for [autoreply/rust](https://crates.io/crates/autoreply) and [autoreply/go](go-server).

We are aiming to have more features in the prototypes, and reasonably high test coverage.
