## 🛠️ Task: Build a Static Embedding Engine via Model2Vec Distillation

### 🎯 Objective
Produce a compact, multilingual, static embedding engine using the **Model2Vec distillation method**. The engine must support fast semantic similarity for short texts (e.g. tweets) on low-end platforms (Node.js, mobile browser). Target runtime: **<100µs per input**.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

1. **Distilled Embedding Table**
   - Token-to-vector map for ~100k multilingual tokens.
   - 64-dimensional embeddings.
   - Quantized to 8-bit precision.
   - Exported in memory-mappable format (e.g. safetensors or flatbuffers).

2. **Tokenizer Runtime**
   - WASM-compatible tokenizer (e.g. Hugging Face `tokenizers`).
   - Must support multilingual input and match the teacher model’s vocabulary.

3. **Embedding Inference Engine**
   - JS/WASM module that:
     - Tokenizes input text.
     - Looks up token embeddings.
     - Averages and L2-normalizes the output vector.
   - Must run in <100µs per input on CPU.

4. **Evaluation Script**
   - Benchmarks semantic similarity quality vs baseline (e.g. fastText, BM25).
   - Measures throughput and memory usage.

### 🧪 Methodology: Model2Vec Distillation

#### 1. Teacher Model
- Use a pretrained multilingual encoder:
  - Preferred: `multilingual-e5-base` (Hugging Face).
  - Alternative: `LaBSE` (if higher quality is needed and GPU time is available).

#### 2. Vocabulary Preparation
- Extract full tokenizer vocabulary (~30k–100k tokens).
- Expand with domain-specific terms (e.g. Twitter slang, hashtags, emojis).

#### 3. Embedding Extraction
- For each token:
  - Wrap in dummy input (e.g. `"query: token"`).
  - Pass through the teacher model.
  - Extract sentence-level embedding (mean pooling or CLS).
- Output: `float32` matrix of shape `[vocab_size × 768]`.

#### 4. Dimensionality Reduction
- Apply PCA to reduce to **64 dimensions**.
- Retain ≥95% variance.
- Save PCA transform metadata.

#### 5. Quantization
- Convert reduced embeddings to **8-bit precision** (int8 or float8).
- Apply per-dimension scaling if needed.
- Validate cosine similarity stability post-quantization.

#### 6. Export
- Save token map and embedding table in safetensors or flatbuffers.
- Ensure format is loadable in browser and Node.js.
- Target final size: ≤10MB.

### ⚙️ Runtime Requirements

- Must run in:
  - Node.js (single-threaded, no GPU).
  - Mobile browser (WASM or WebGL2).
- Embedding lookup + pooling must complete in <100µs per input.
- Total memory footprint ≤10MB.
- No transformer inference at runtime — embeddings must be static.

## 🧠 Notes

### 1. This is a Model2Vec-style engine — no contextualization at runtime

The embedding table is static. At runtime, the engine does not run any transformer layers, attention mechanisms, or dynamic inference.

That guarantees microsecond-level performance and low memory usage. All semantic richness must come from the distillation phase.

**Developer implication**: Runtime must be a pure lookup + pooling + normalization pipeline. No calls to Hugging Face Transformers or ONNX models during inference.


### 2. Token coverage must include multilingual slang, hashtags, emojis

The vocabulary must go beyond the default tokenizer’s base lexicon.

Tweets and short texts often contain informal, domain-specific tokens that are semantically important.

**Developer implication**:
- Expand the vocabulary with curated lists: e.g. emoji sets, Twitter slang, common hashtags.
- Ensure these tokens are passed through the teacher model during distillation.
- Include them in the final embedding table.

### 3. Stretch goal: support weighted pooling such as Zipf

Instead of averaging token embeddings equally, apply weights based on token importance or frequency.

That improves semantic fidelity by down-weighting common stopwords and up-weighting informative tokens.

**Developer implication**:
- Implement optional pooling strategies, consider if these can be pre-computed or need to be dynamic at inference time:
  - Uniform average (default).
  - Zipf-based weighting (based on token frequency).
  - TF-IDF-style weighting (if corpus stats are available).
- Make pooling strategy configurable to experiment and pick the right option.

### 4. Stretch goal: include PCA transform for future re-expansion or analysis

Save the PCA matrix used to compress 768D → 64D embeddings.

That enables future upgrades, diagnostics, or re-expansion to higher dimensions if needed.

**Developer implication**:
- Save PCA components and mean vector.
- Store in a separate file or embed in metadata.
- Format should be compatible with NumPy or JS matrix libraries.
