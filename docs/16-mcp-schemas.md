# Structured content versus text

## Current state

Both Go and Rust implementations define a `ToolResult` structure that contains a list of `ContentItem` objects. A `ContentItem` consists of a `type` (e.g., "text"), the `text` content, and optional `metadata`.

### Go Implementation

- The `tools/call` handler expects each tool's `Call` method to return a `(*ToolResult, error)`.
- The returned `ToolResult` object is directly serialized as the `result` field in the final JSON-RPC response.
- The `search` tool constructs a single `ContentItem` of type `text`, where the content is a large, pre-formatted Markdown string.

### Rust Implementation

- The `tools/call` dispatcher (`handle_tool_call`) routes requests to specific tool handlers (e.g., `handle_search`).
- Each tool handler is responsible for creating the entire `McpResponse` object, either for success or failure.
- A successful tool execution builds a `ToolResult` struct. This struct is then serialized into a `serde_json::Value` and placed inside the `result` field of the `McpResponse`.
- The `search` tool, similar to the Go version, returns a `ToolResult` containing a single `ContentItem` with its content being a formatted Markdown string.

In both cases, the tool result is effectively a single block of text, formatted as Markdown, and delivered within a `ContentItem`.

### Per-tool summary (Go server)

- `accounts`
	- Input schema: object with optional `action` (string: "list" | "set-default") and optional `handle` (string).
	- Output: `mcp.ToolResult` with one `ContentItem` of `type: "text"` containing Markdown. `list` returns a Markdown list of accounts; `set-default` returns a Markdown confirmation. No structured JSON output is provided (metadata is unused).

- `login`
	- Input schema: object with optional `handle` (string), optional `password` (string), optional `prompt_id` (string), optional `port` (integer).
	- Output: returns `mcp.ToolResult` with `ContentItem`s. Behavior:
		- On success or informative failures, returns a `text` content item with Markdown. No dedicated structured success object is returned.

- `logout`
	- Input schema: object with optional `handle` (string).
	- Output: `mcp.ToolResult` with a single `text` `ContentItem` containing Markdown confirmation. No structured result.

- `profile`
	- Input schema: object with required `account` (string).
	- Output: `mcp.ToolResult` with a single `text` `ContentItem` containing a rich Markdown profile (link, DID, display name, description, avatar, stats and a raw JSON details section). No separate structured/profile JSON is returned; raw data is embedded inside Markdown.

- `search`
	- Input schema: object with required `account` (string), required `query` (string), optional `limit` (integer).
	- Output: `mcp.ToolResult` with a single `text` `ContentItem` containing Markdown-formatted search results (header, per-post sections, embeds summary, summary footer). No structured JSON list of posts or per-post metadata is returned (all is in Markdown).

### Per-tool summary (Rust server)

- `login` (handler `tools::login::handle_login`)
	- Input schema: generated from `cli::LoginCommand` (exposed via `tools/list`). Typically contains `handle`, `password`, etc.
	- Output: returns a `ToolResult` (serialized into the RPC `result`) with one or more `ContentItem`s:
		- On success, returns a `text` `ContentItem` with Markdown. No distinct structured success object is returned.

- `profile` (handler `tools::profile::handle_profile`)
	- Input schema: generated from `cli::ProfileArgs` (exposed via `tools/list`), requires `account`.
	- Output: returns `ToolResult::text(markdown)` which is serialized into the JSON-RPC `result`. The Markdown contains profile fields and a raw JSON section; there is no separate structured JSON profile in the `result`.

# Immediate action: Replace input_text pattern with standard MCP elicitation/create requests

Summary: The project was migrated to the standard MCP elicitation flow. The codebase now uses server-initiated `elicitation/create` requests (when clients advertise the capability), removes custom `prompt_id` usage from input schemas, and implements a fallback that returns a `ToolResult` with `isError: true` and clear, user-friendly guidance when clients do not support elicitation. Password-related messaging follows the required security guidance (warn against main account passwords, point to app-password creation, and prefer OAuth). Tests verify elicitation and fallback behaviors.


# Immediate action: Align Go tools list, parameters and behaviour to Rust tools

Summary: The Go MCP tools were consolidated to match the Rust tool surface. `accounts` was merged into `login` as subcommands (list/default/delete) while preserving Go's explicit `InputSchema` objects and credential storage semantics. `tools/list` now exposes `login`, `profile`, and `search` with aligned schemas. Error signaling and elicitation behavior were normalized and covered by unit and integration tests.
	- Once tests pass and `tools/list` matches Rust, remove the `accounts` tool registration and any duplicate CLI wiring.

Notes (non-functional)
 - Preserve the readable Markdown outputs; the plan only changes tool names/parameters and error signaling, not the user-facing text formatting.
 - If backward compatibility is required for external MCP clients that currently call `accounts`, provide a short-term compatibility shim: register `accounts` as an alias that forwards to `login` until clients migrate.

Acceptance criteria (final)
 - `tools/list` exposes `login`, `profile`, `search` with matching schemas.
 - Login subcommands `list|default|delete` replicate existing `accounts` behavior.

# Simplify tool schema: The Plan

## Vision: Markdown-Structured Output for LLM Consumption

The architecture doc says it plainly: "BlueSky data is too rich and verbose for LLM." MCP tools should return **slim, natural, scannable text** ‚Äî not JSON.

### Why Markdown?
- **Token efficient**: 45% fewer tokens than JSON (measured on real data)
- **LLM-native**: Models are trained on natural language, not schemas
- **Scannable**: `üëç 14` beats `{"likes": {"count": 14}}`

### The Critical Problem: Content Ambiguity

**User content can contain Markdown syntax.** If a BlueSky post says:

```
Check out my project!
## Features
- Fast
- Simple
```

And our tool outputs:

```markdown
@alice/3kq6b3f1
## Features
- Fast
- Simple
üëç 12
```

How does the LLM know `## Features` is user content, not a tool section header?

### The Solution: Blockquote Prefix

Prefix user content lines with `>` ‚Äî the Markdown blockquote syntax. This clearly delimits content from structure:

```markdown
@alice/3kq6b3f1
> ## Features
> - Fast
> - Simple
üëç 12  üí¨ 4  2024-10-06T10:05:33Z
```

**Why this works:**
- Unambiguous: blockquotes are visually distinct
- Familiar: `>` is standard Markdown, widely understood
- Simple: prepend `> ` to each content line
- LLMs trained on this convention (email replies, forum quotes)
- Renders nicely in Markdown viewers (indented block)
- User's Markdown stays intact inside the quote

## Design Conventions

```

The thread indicators are only there on the first line of the post. That keeps the subsequent Markdown of the post content/stats untainted and valid blockquote-style.

The indentation is reflecting from which level the reply is going.

The first extra-compacted link is for disambiguation to which post this one is replying. It uses only first letter of the handle, and only last four digits of the ref key. But if that replied-to post is not in the current thread, a full @handle/refkey is used without compaction.

The content of the post is then block-quoted.

Images are converted to Markdown notation below the text, (still inside block quote or no?) with ALT text used in the square brackets as intended.

The stats and the timestamp go last.
